    of the ``DurationSeconds`` we pass, so this cadence must be strictly
    less than 60 s to prevent the status from lapsing between ticks.

    Gating is driven entirely off DB state (``character.last_online`` +

    mod server's transient ``/players`` snapshot.  This avoids dropping
    legitimate suspects when the mod's player list momentarily misses a
    GUID (2 s cache miss, brief API hiccup, missing ``location`` field
    while loading in, etc.) which previously caused the GE to expire.

    Emits ``clear_suspect`` only for players whose *combined* suspect
    status (wanted OR wearing-costume) transitioned to cleared — so a
    wanted→not-wanted transition while the player is still wearing a

    Called every minute via arq cron. Applies exponential decay with a

    confiscatable amount so they cannot escape punishment by logging off.

    Players currently in a modded vehicle are excluded from decay —
    their confiscatable amount is preserved as long as they remain in
    a modified vehicle.

    Players who are AFK (bAFK=true) are also excluded from decay.
