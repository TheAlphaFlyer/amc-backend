    For rich or experienced players we want progression to slow down so
    the system stays stable — they can still earn subsidies, but never
    at a net cost to the treasury on a given delivery.

    Eligibility (clamp applies if EITHER is true):

      - experienced player (`character.driver_level` at or above

        haven't accumulated wealth yet but are already past the early
        learning curve.

    NEW + inexperienced players are exempt -> full subsidy preserved.

    The clamp is `min(subsidy, tax)`, applied *after* all other player
    cuts (treasury cap, wealth lerp, modded vehicle multiplier). This
    means:
      - Treasury healthy -> tax curve drops to ~0 -> subsidy clamped to ~0
