"""ASEAN Tax engine.

Mirrors the structure of `amc.subsidies.get_subsidy_for_cargo` /
`subsidise_player`, but flows funds INTO the treasury instead of out.

Tax is computed on the *raw* base cargo payment (post-fraud-clawback,
pre-subsidy, pre-supply-chain-bonus). Treasury cap is *inverted* so tax
decreases as the treasury fills, supporting the design goal of keeping
net flow positive into the treasury while protecting players from
runaway taxation when the government is already rich.
